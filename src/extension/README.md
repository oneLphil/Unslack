# Setup steps

1. Install node according to this: https://angular.io/guide/quickstart
2. Git clone this repo, cd into the extensions folder, and do "git checkout chrome-ext-base-gui"
3. Execute "npm install" to install all the dependencies and setup the environment
4. Run "ng serve" to start the webserver (so changes you make to the app can be viewed instantly)

# Development Notes

1. If Angular 5 is new to you, read and try the tutorials: https://angular.io/guide/quickstart
2. Make branches off of this branch (chrome-ext-base-gui) to make your own changes
(This makes it so that if we need to revert back, it's easier to prevent everyone else's code from changing)
3. Pull request to this branch (chrome-ext-base-gui) when you are confident
