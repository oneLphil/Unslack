[Transcript of the planning meeting](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2018/project-team-02/blob/master/deliverables/Planning%20meeting%20transcript)

Found an example of how we roughly want the extension to be displayed to the user, similar to [Trackr](https://github.com/srikarg/Trackr). (See [Figure 2 of product.md](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2018/project-team-02/blob/master/deliverables/product.md))

Design how a users ranked among their peers and how they will improve their habits. (See [Figure 1 of product.md](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2018/project-team-02/blob/master/deliverables/product.md))
