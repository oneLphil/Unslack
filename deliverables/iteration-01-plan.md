We keep track of what needs to be done using a google sheet.

Tasks are prioritized based on how important tasks are to be done and assigned by the scrum master.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks that will have to be met and completed

Decide what problem we will try to solve and design a solution to the problem

Decide which medium/platform is best for the solution

Decide on the core extension features

Design how the extension will look like and function

Decide on languages to use for a google chrome extension

Decide on how to store data

Decide on a points and reward system implementation

#### Artifacts

[Transcript of the planning meeting](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2018/project-team-02/blob/master/deliverables/Planning%20meeting%20transcript)

Found an example of how we roughly want the extension to be displayed to the user, similar to [Trackr](https://github.com/srikarg/Trackr). (See [Figure 2 of product.md](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2018/project-team-02/blob/master/deliverables/product.md))

Design how a users ranked among their peers and how they will improve their habits. (See [Figure 1 of product.md](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2018/project-team-02/blob/master/deliverables/product.md))

# TEMPLATE REQUIREMENTS
#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
