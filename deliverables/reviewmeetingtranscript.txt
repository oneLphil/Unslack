Kevin: We wrote in Decision 3 that we would have a rewards system and rankings. What are we going to do about the rewards?
Phillip: we can do trophy/badges for now?
Steve: I think one of the reward ideas was to give time that's not counted as well, but that can be an additional feature
Kevin: Sounds like a good idea tho
Kevin: One way to reward users and keep balance inside their agreements
Alana: Yeah it sounds good
Kevin: Ok I've copied down the template requirements inside each of the iteration google docs
we need to talk about these details in this current review meeting
so we can write somehting down for this review meeting lol
Phillip: did we plan to discuss how the extension should look?
oh I guess you are writing we did not get to that part
doesnt that go into review and not plan ?
in the review we have to say whether or not we completed these goals for this iteration in relation to the product
Kevin:
Decide what problem we will try to solve and design a solution to the problem

Decide which medium/platform is best for the solution

Decide on the core extension features

Design how the extension will look like and function

Decide on languages to use for a google chrome extension

Decide on using a server to store database with java

Decide on a points and reward system implementation

Phillip: I think the 2nd last one should be in the review
that kinda goes into we decided to use java for server
so the iteration-01-plan is meant for us to describe all the goals we want to achieve for this iteration
and the itearation -01-review is meant for us to write down whether or not we achieved those goals mentioned in the iteration-01-plan at the end of our review meeting
Kevin: ya
"Decide on using a server to store database with java" is a decision not a plan though
David: It's also gramatical spaghetti
Kevin: we already accomplished that goal by saying that we are going to use a server
we need to change up the wording of these goals
Phillip: ya so it should go into the review section
Kevin: it's in both the review and plan
we're just gonna copy and paste all those goals cuz we finished them
and for this current meeting we're also gonna have to talk about our goals for the next meeting
Alana: Goals for the next meeting could be starting to discuss the architecture of the project, or maybe deciding on some UI/UX aspects?
Kevin: Sounds like a plan
maybe do some CRC cards
David: crc cards are a huge waste of time
Phillip: is there an online UML tool we can all share and work on?
Alana: They make good artifacts though
Phillip: ya thats what I was thinking haha
artifacts
Alana: As “proof”
Kevin: just to be clear on what we are doing for this current review meeting now
## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items

 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)

 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.

 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.

 * Can be related to product and/or process.
 
David: we should definitely plan our architecture and software
but crc cards are way too much imo
planning high level stuff is important, but making crc cards for anything not-high level is pointless work
Alana: Hm then we could try to meet in person and draw some high level diagrams and stuff on a whiteboard and take a picture like Adam suggested
Or someone could just jot it down on paper
And like we submit that as an artifact
Steve: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, some kind of high-level design diagram
Kevin: yea let's set that as our artifact for architecture planning
we should research on the javascript stacks as part of the software aspect right?
Phillip: that would probably go under our planning session for iteration-2
it would be one of our tasks
I'm gona head to class now, I will connect to chat once I get there
Steve: I transcripted the planning meeting, so we can use that for an artifact
Alana: Awesome!
