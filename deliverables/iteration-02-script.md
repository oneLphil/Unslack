 > (over the shoulder)
 
 > Person 2: “He keeps saying that’s he’s busy with other courses. I don’t believe him though.”
 
 > (cut to david watch youtube)
 
 > Person 1: “If only we had some way to keep him and ourselves accountable.”
 
 > Person 2: “I’ve heard there’s this new extension called Unslack that could help us. We can use Unslack to create a room for our group so we can keep track of our own and each other’s productivity.”


<h3>Demo (1½ - 2 minutes)</h3>
<strong>Demonstrate your product<br/>
Present it from the user’s perspective, and guide the audience through the most common user flow.</strong><br/>
<br/>
<h4>Demo the front-end:</h4>

> Once the user has downloaded the chrome extension, it will immediately begin tracking their browser activity

> By clicking on the icon in the toolbar, they can access a high level view of their top 15 websites that they visit, based on time

> They can also open a full dashboard that shows a quick overview of the rooms they are in.

> There’s also a button to create or join a room. 

> There are also options to view details from all your website browsing activity.

> You can also view detailed information from rooms that you are currently in, including a ranked list of everyone’s productivity.

<h4>Demo the back end:</h4>

> To make rooms possible, we use a java server which is responsible for accepting messages from the client.

> Here, we're running a couple of programs that send a create room message

> As you can see, the new room that User requested has been created, with user already being added to the Room

> The server will also be used to calculate everyone’s score based on their browsing history and each room’s specific settings

<h3>Final discussion (30-45 seconds)</h3>
<strong>Summarize what we saw. Briefly discuss what you’re planning to do next</strong><br/>

> Voiceover: In summary, Unslack currently can track browser activity, visualize data, and display room information. The server currently accepts and parses messages, and can store browsing and room data.

> Person 1: So you’re saying that, Unslack aims to help users track their online activity and motivate them to improve their productivity through social accountability?

> Person 2: I heard that in the next few weeks, the developers are planning on adding the ability to change room settings, implement room scoring, and connect the backend to the UI. 

> Both people: “Wow. “
Person 1: “I guess, it’s time for us to Unslack!”

<h3>Next Steps:</h3>

> Backend integration with Frontend

> Scoring system and Gamification

> Allow clearing of website data
