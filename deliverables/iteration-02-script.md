### Introduction (30-45 seconds)

**Give the audience some context. Tell the audience what they are about to watch**

**Videographer & Video Editor = Alana**<br/>
**Person 1 = Kevin**<br/>
**Person 2 = Graeme**<br/>
**Slacker & Demo narrator = David**<br/>

 **(wide shot)**
 
 **Person 1:** “Hey (person 2), have you noticed how (slacker) hasn’t been doing anything for our project?
 
 **(over the shoulder)**
 
 **Person 2:** “He keeps saying that’s he’s busy with other courses. I don’t believe him though.”
 
 **(cut to david watch youtube)**
 
 **Person 1:** “If only we had some way to keep him and ourselves accountable.”
 
 **Person 2:** “I’ve heard there’s this new extension called Unslack that could help us. We can use Unslack to create a room for our group so we can keep track of our own and each other’s productivity.”


### Demo (1½ - 2 minutes)
**Demonstrate your product. Present it from the user’s perspective, and guide the audience through the most common user flow.**

**Demo the front-end:**

* Once the user has downloaded the chrome extension, it will immediately begin tracking their browser activity

* By clicking on the icon in the toolbar, they can access a high level view of their top 15 websites that they visit, based on time

* They can also open a full dashboard that shows a quick overview of the rooms they are in.

* There’s also a button to create or join a room. 

* There are also options to view details from all your website browsing activity.

* You can also view detailed information from rooms that you are currently in, including a ranked list of everyone’s productivity.

#### Demo the back end:

* To make rooms possible, we use a java server which is responsible for accepting messages from the client.

* Here, we're running a couple of programs that send a create room message

* As you can see, the new room that User requested has been created, with user already being added to the Room

* The server will also be used to calculate everyone’s score based on their browsing history and each room’s specific settings

### Final discussion (30-45 seconds)
**Summarize what we saw. Briefly discuss what you’re planning to do next**

**Voiceover:** In summary, Unslack currently can track browser activity, visualize data, and display room information. The server currently accepts and parses messages, and can store browsing and room data.

**Person 1:** So you’re saying that, Unslack aims to help users track their online activity and motivate them to improve their productivity through social accountability?

**Person 2:** I heard that in the next few weeks, the developers are planning on adding the ability to change room settings, implement room scoring, and connect the backend to the UI. 

**Both people:** “Wow. “

**Person 1:** “I guess, it’s time for us to Unslack!”

**Next Steps:**

* Backend integration with Frontend

* Scoring system and Gamification

* Allow clearing of website data
